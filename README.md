# Hospital Length of Stay Prediction
 
## Overview

This repository contains a predictive analytics project aimed at estimating the length of stay (LOS) for patients in a hospital setting. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide insights that can help optimize resource allocation and improve patient care.

The primary artifact in this repository is the Jupyter Notebook file Hospital_LOS_Prediction.ipynb, which contains the entire data processing, model training, and evaluation workflow.

## Features

Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in hospital data.

Multiple machine learning models for LOS prediction.

Model performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

Insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Requirements

The project requires Python and the following libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost 

To install the required packages, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Ensure to create a requirements.txt file with the necessary libraries listed.)


## Key Steps in the Notebook

### Data Loading and Exploration:

Summary statistics, missing values, and data distribution.

### Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations to explore relationships between features and LOS.

### Model Training and Evaluation:

Train-test split, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

### Results and Insights:

Final model predictions and actionable recommendations for improving hospital efficiency.
